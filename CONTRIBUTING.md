# Contributing to swedbank-pay-js

:+1::tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Electron website on
GitHub. These are just guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgment and feel
free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Issues and Pull Requests

- If you're not sure about adding something, [open an issue][] to discuss it.
- Feel free to open a Pull Request early so that a discussion can be had as
  changes are developed.

## Commit Messages and Pull Request Titles

We use the [Conventional Commits][] specification to standardize our commit
history. To enforce this convention on commit messages and/or pull request
titles, we use the [Semantic Pull Requests][] bot.

The commit message summary (or pull request title) is constructed by prepending
the type of change being made (e.g., feat, fix, refactor), followed by an
imperative, present tense sentence (without a period). Example:
`fix: make header bold`.

If you are still working on your pull request, prepend `WIP:` to indicate that
it's work in progress.

### Pull Request Title

Same as commit messages, prepend the type of change being made (refactor, fix,
chore, feat, etc.) Example: `docs: add linux setup instructions`

## Documentation

Most of the documentation are automatically generated. We utilize `typedoc` that
uses tags inline with classes in order to generate. The nice thing about this is
that documentation will be visible when using Typescript in editors as well.

You can generate documentation with the following command:

```shell
â–¶ yarn generate-docs
```

However, we love to have examples and guides as well.

## Releasing

This package utilizes [semantic release][] to manage releasing. We have two
release channels; `main` and `develop`. Our Github Actions workflow
automatically releases a canary release on `develop` as long as at least one
commit message follows [Conventional Commits][].

When the team decides to, `develop` is merged into `main` to release as stable
release.

- `develop` should be considered as unstable code (not ready for production).
  e.g. `v1.0.3-develop.5`
- `main` should be considered stable. e.g. `v1.0.3`

These are both considered [release branches][] as per Semantic Release
documentation.

## Need Help?

If any of this information confusing, incorrect, or incomplete, feel free to
[open an issue][] for help.
